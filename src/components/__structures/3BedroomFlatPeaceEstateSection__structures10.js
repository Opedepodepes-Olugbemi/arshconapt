We've also learned that when the culture of sharing is brought in earlier, the better teams adapt and communicate with one another.</p>        <p className="text-lg text-gray-800">That's why we are excited to share that we now have a <a className="decoration-2 hover:underline font-medium text-red-600 hover:text-red-400" href="#">Arshlon &amp; Forms Limited</a>, which will allow individual designers, startups and other small teams a chance to create a culture of openness early on.</p>        <figure>          <img className="w-full object-cover rounded-xl" src="https://static.shuffle.dev/uploads/files/3b/3bd7a8feac6edf952a72f7ffe12d973401d1bac7/project-14-jpg-1721639582478.webp" alt="Image Description" />          <figcaption className="mt-3 text-sm text-center text-gray-500 dark:text-neutral-500">2 bedroom on ground floor of front apartment and 4 bedroom duplex on back apartment plus parking space for both apartment on a 300sqm land.</figcaption>      </figure>        <div className="space-y-3">          <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold dark:text-white">Bringing the culture of sharing to everyone</h3>          <p className="text-lg text-gray-800">We know the power of sharing is real, and we want to create an opportunity for everyone to try Preline and explore how transformative open communication can be. Now you can have a team of one or two designers and unlimited spectators (think PMs, management, marketing, etc.) share work and explore the design process earlier.</p>      </div>        <ul className="list-disc list-outside space-y-5 ps-5 text-lg text-gray-800">          <li className="ps-2">Preline allows us to collaborate in real time and is a really great way for leadership on the team to stay up-to-date with what everybody is working on," <a className="decoration-2 hover:underline font-medium text-red-600 hover:text-red-400" href="#">said</a> Stewart Scott-Curran, Intercom's Director of Brand Design.</li>      </ul>        <p className="text-lg text-gray-800">Small teams and individual designers need a space where they can watch the design process unfold, both for themselves and for the people they work with â€“ no matter if it's a fellow designer, product manager, developer or client. Preline allows you to invite more people into the process, creating a central place for conversation around design. As those teams grow, transparency and collaboration becomes integrated in how they communicate and work together.</p>        <div><a className="m-1 inline-flex items-center gap-1.5 py-2 px-3 rounded-full text-sm bg-gray-100 text-gray-800 hover:bg-gray-200" href="#">Architecture</a><a className="m-1 inline-flex items-center gap-1.5 py-2 px-3 rounded-full text-sm bg-gray-100 text-gray-800 hover:bg-gray-200" href="#">Innovate</a><a className="m-1 inline-flex items-center gap-1.5 py-2 px-3 rounded-full text-sm bg-gray-100 text-gray-800 hover:bg-gray-200" href="#">Free</a><a className="m-1 inline-flex items-center gap-1.5 py-2 px-3 rounded-full text-sm bg-gray-100 text-gray-800 hover:bg-gray-200" href="#">Development</a></div>    </div>      {/* End Content */}  </div></div>  {/* End Blog Article */}  {/* Sticky Share Group */}  {/* End Sticky Share Group */}</div>
